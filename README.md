# UniversidadUNLP_Portfolio
This is a personal collection of the most relevant projects and exercises from my university coursework throughout the semester. It’s not meant to be a complete or definitive portfolio — just a selection of the work I’ve enjoyed the most during my academic journey.

Everything is organized into sections by subject or module. Feel free to explore, check out the topics covered, and get a sense of the kind of work I do and how I approach it.

Here, you’ll find only me — my answers, my ideas, and the exercises I found most interesting.
