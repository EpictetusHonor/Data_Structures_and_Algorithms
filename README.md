# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) refer to the fundamental concepts used to organize, store, and process data efficiently in computer science. Data structures define the layout and management of data, while algorithms provide the step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems.

This repository contains implementations of essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
I I will gradually add implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, as well as algorithms for sorting, searching, and traversals, as I progress through my university studies.
The main goal is to develop solid foundations in problem-solving and overall programming knowledge with the broader objective of progressing in my university studies and becoming a programmer with some skills beyond those of most others.

As a reference, I'm using the book:
Algoritmos y Programación en Pascal by Cristóbal Pareja Flores, Manuel Ojeda Aciego, Ángel Andeyro Quesada, and Carlos Rossi Jiménez.
